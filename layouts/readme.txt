There are basically three main ways we can create layouts.

Layouts are the way text images cards and other content is
arranged on the web page.

Layout gives the page a visual structure, into which we place our
content.

Not only the page, but the components in the page have a layout.

1. Float layouts -  still used, but getting outdated fast.
2. Flexbox - perfect for building 1 dimensional layouts
3. CSS Grid - build complete 2d layouts, and more complex components

Float layouts use float, margin and padding heavily. They also use
a clearfix with clear:both, conten:"" and display:block css properties.
Those who worked on css created flexbox and css grid just to avoid
working like this.

Flexbox layouts are a set of related css properties for building
one dimensional layouts. The main idea behind it is that empty space
inside a container can be automatically divide by its child elements.
Also makes it easy to align items, vertically center, and create equal
height columns.
